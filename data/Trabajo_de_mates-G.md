## IT COSTS MORE GAS TO INITIALIZE VARIABLES WITH THEIR DEFAULT VALUE THAN LETTING THE DEFAULT VALUE BE APPLIED

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (0 for uint, false for bool, address(0) for addressâ€¦). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

As an example: for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i) { should be replaced with for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {
