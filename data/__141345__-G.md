#### Variable re-arrangement by storage packing

Reference: [Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/internals/layout_in_storage.html).

1. In `struct AppStorage`, `bool zkPorterIsAvailable` can be placed before `address governor`, as a result, 1 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, they can be packed into 1 slot.

```solidity
// ethereum/contracts/zksync/Storage.sol
struct AppStorage {
    address governor;
    // ...
    bool zkPorterIsAvailable;
}
```

2. In `struct DiamondStorage`, `bool isFrozen` can be placed before `mapping(bytes4 => SelectorToFacet) selectorToFacet`, as a result, 1 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, they can be packed into 1 slot.

```solidity
// ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol
    struct DiamondStorage {
        mapping(bytes4 => SelectorToFacet) selectorToFacet;
        mapping(address => FacetToSelectors) facetToSelectors;
        address[] facets;
        bool isFrozen;
    }
```

3. In `struct FacetCut`, `bool isFreezable` can be placed before `address facet`, as a result, 1 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, they can be packed into 1 slot.

```solidity
// ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol
    struct FacetCut {
        address facet;
        Action action;
        bool isFreezable;
        bytes4[] selectors;
    }
```

#### Update value order can be adjusted to simplify the code and save gas

For example, to update the `num` variable with `newVal`, the current way is as following:

```solidity
    uint oldVal = num;
    num = newVal;
    emit update(oldVal, newVal);
```

If the execution order is adjusted, some operations can be saved (memory space allocation, variable assignment), reducing both the deployment and run time gas cost.

```solidity
    emit update(num, newVal);
    num = newVal;
```

The operation saved: 1 sload, 1 memory allocation, 1 mstore.

The demo of the gas comparison can be seen [here](https://github.com/141345/gas_demo/blob/main/oldnew.sol).



Instances number of this issue: 
```solidity
// ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Governance.sol
    function setVerifierParams(VerifierParams calldata _newVerifierParams) external onlyGovernor {
        VerifierParams memory oldVerifierParams = s.verifierParams;

        s.verifierParams = _newVerifierParams;
        emit NewVerifierParams(oldVerifierParams, _newVerifierParams);
    }
```

The above can be changed to:
```solidity
    function setVerifierParams(VerifierParams calldata _newVerifierParams) external onlyGovernor {
        emit NewVerifierParams(s.verifierParams, _newVerifierParams);

        s.verifierParams = _newVerifierParams;
    }
```

#### Splitting `require()` statements that use &&

`require()` statements with multiple conditions can be split.

See this [issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128) which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper.

The demo of the gas comparison can be seen [here](https://github.com/141345/gas_demo/blob/main/multirequire.sol).
