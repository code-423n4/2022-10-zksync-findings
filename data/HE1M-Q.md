### NO. 1
The critical parameters in `initialize(...)` are not set safely:

 - `s.governor` should be set to `msg.sender`, because a wrong governor address will result in loss of access to all other parts, and later changing the governor to the correct address.
 - `_l2BootloaderBytecodeHash` should be validated like `L2ContractHelper.validateBytecodeHash(_l2BootloaderBytecodeHash)` as in `GovernanceFacet`
 - `_l2DefaultAccountBytecodeHash` should be validated like `L2ContractHelper.validateBytecodeHash(_l2DefaultAccountBytecodeHash)` as in `GovernanceFacet`

### NO. 2
Better to have also `approveEmergencyDiamondCutAsSecurityCouncilMemberBySignature`, in case the security council members do not have access to ethereum blockchain or in case it is needed to approve just in one transaction by batch of signatures (to bypass the notice period).

### No. 3
Better to have config facet, in case some update is needed in the `config.sol`. Therefore, it is not necessary to redeploy the facets that imported config (like `Executor` and `Mailbox`)

### No. 4
`L2_LOG_BYTES` is not correct, it should be `L2_TO_L1_LOG_SERIALIZE_SIZE`
