## [L-01] Use of Block.timestamp

Block timestamps have historically been used for a variety of applications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the Entropy Illusion for further details), locking funds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional statements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block timestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts.

File: ethereum\contracts\zksync\facets\Executor.sol
```
50: bool timestampNotTooSmall = block.timestamp - COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_NOT_OLDER <= l2BlockTimestamp;
51: bool timestampNotTooBig = l2BlockTimestamp <= block.timestamp + COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_APPROXIMATION_DELTA;


```

File: ethereum\contracts\zksync\facets\DiamondCut.sol
```
52: bool upgradeNoticePeriodPassed = block.timestamp >= s.diamondCutStorage.proposedDiamondCutTimestamp + UPGRADE_NOTICE_PERIOD;
```


### [L-02] Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so itâ€™s not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

```solidity
16:     event DiamondCut(FacetCut[] facetCuts, address initAddress, bytes initCalldata);


```

File: ethereum\contracts\zksync\interfaces\IMailbox.sol
```solidity
    event NewPriorityRequest(
        uint256 txId,
        bytes32 txHash,
        uint64 expirationBlock,
        L2CanonicalTransaction transaction,
        bytes[] factoryDeps
    );
```
